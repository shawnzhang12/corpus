## Swimming Forms

### Freestyle (Frontcrawl)

Fast. 

### Backcrawl

Chill on the neck.

### Breaststroke

Chill on the spine.

### Butterfly 

Fast and furious. Big on the back.

## Swimming Styles (Freestyle)

### Total Immersion

This form of swimming prioritizes reducing drag, keeping streamlined, and increasing stride length instead of frequency. Seems very chill and a good form for comfort (will probably do this when I'm 50), but not the method for high speeds.

### Swim Smooth

This form of swimming prioritizes speed by propulsion, and is used by elite swimmers and triathletes. This method focuses on increasing stroke frequency and probably consumes more oxygen and energy. Good time to pick it up while I'm young.
