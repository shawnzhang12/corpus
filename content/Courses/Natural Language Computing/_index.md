## Overview

natural language computing - get computers to understand what we say and write, statistics of language

application:

text classification, language translation, speech recognition, natural language understanding, information retrieval, interpretability and LLMs

one of the ultimate human-computer interaction

a little deeper: how are sounds and text related, how are words combined to make sentences, meaning and organization

linguistics knowledge: 

phonology: patterns of speech sounds

morphology: changed by inflection

syntax: ordering and structure between word and phrases,

semantics: study of how meaning is created by words and phrases

pragmatics: the study of meaning in contexts



Ambiguity - Phonological

problem for speech synthesis: read/read

problem for speech recognition: too, two

context: how to wreck a nice beach, how to recognize speech

syntax ambiguity: buffalo buffalo buffaloooooo

syntactic ambiguity: ordering and structure between words, tree parsing

semantic ambiguity: every man loves a woman, i made her duck, give me the pot

miscellaneous ambiguity: news headlines

nlp: resolve ambiguity, reason with world knowledge, tend to use probability, turing test

Chatbots: ELIZA pattern matching



applications:

machine translation: interpretation and generation, word-to-word was popular, syntactic ambiguities, definitions, solution use statistical machine translation

waveforms and spectrograms, speech recognition
