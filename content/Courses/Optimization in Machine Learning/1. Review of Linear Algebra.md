### Vectors and Matrices

$$
A^{m \times n} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
   a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n}\\
   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
   a_{m1} & a_{m2} &  \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Matrix Properties



Systems of Linear Equations

Products of  $N_1.....N_n$ 

no solution, exactly one solution (independent), infinite solutions (linear dependence)

geometric interpretation

solving linear systems (real valued) easy because polynomial time

reduced row echelon againn

linear combination

linear independence notation

convex combination (non-negative lambdas that sum up to 1)
