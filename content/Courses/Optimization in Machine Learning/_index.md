#Week 1

variables, constraints, metrics --> optimization problem

data center example, using services and machines

importance: linear optimization accounts for 5% (1 trillion dollars) of economy quote

tailor algorithms to family of instances, eg resource management or online matching

overview

AI: do non-trivial tasks well, do hard tasks that humans struggle with

subgoals: perception, reasoning, control, planning

examples: game playing - reasoning + planning, autonomous driving - all four

knowledge based ai - known facts, first order logic, and/or/not constraint satisfaction, need deep domain knowledge, 

data-based ai = machine learning: dont need to know, need many examples, explainability?

supervised learning task: performance P (optimization here, loss function, metrics), task T (learn mapping from input to output), experience E (examples)
