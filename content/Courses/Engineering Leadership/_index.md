Giving Good Feedback

1. The micro-yes, a short question that paces that feedback is about to be given, feeling of autonomy
2. specific, data points, objective, specify exactly what it done or not done
3. impact statement, what was the result, brain loves purpose
4. wrap with a question, creates commitment rather than competence

also actively pulls for feedback (not wait for push feedback)

Reflection:

I have set up a filter and everything coming in is always being processed. Very picky filter.

















My first reaction was that I should use chatgpt, this is because I recently remember a haiku from chatgpt about 404 errors and that chatgpt can do this. I like to avoid thinking when possible, i like keeping my brain at low maintenance. not very surprising considering im a lazy guy. i didnt really feel frustrated during the process, but felt most energized when i tried to think of a 5 syllable phrase to end off the haiku about keep trying or not giving up even after failing. part of me doesnt like being energized cuz it consumes energy.



Week 4 Reflection:

I am an introverted analytical person, not very surprising, but I feel that sometimes I could also be expressive when I have enough energy. Other people such as drivers, amiables, and expressives actually exist. That's wild. 





Week 5 Reflection:

I notice that when I show up to teams I'm pretty energy reserved and overall not very interactive. Most times this is highly related to the content that the team is made around, but I see this for sports teams as well. I think in general I don't like the idea of high energy output and more of the low level long term energy output.
