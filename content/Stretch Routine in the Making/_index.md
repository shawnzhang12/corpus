## My approach to keep my body functioning (because I don't like constant pain) :skull_and_crossbones:

Instead of going to the gym and working out on your typical arms, legs, back, whatever. My question is this: What problems do old people have? This forms the premise of how I want to structure my exercises meant for strengthening my body for mobility (strength + range of motion). We can go into speed and mind-body coordination some other time. Find out what parts of the body fail first and let's work on that instead. 

Common problematic areas affecting seniors: 

- Overall joint pain and inflammation
- Knees
- Hips
- Spine
- Lower Back
- Fingers

Don't see biceps or quads there huh? Yeah, low on the priority list (make a sports and training session post later).
