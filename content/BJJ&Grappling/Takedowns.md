### Double Leg Takedown

#### Tips
If collar-tied, let go and pop their arms with C clamps real fast:
- pop arms with C clamp real fast
- Get knee between their legs
- stay upright, head close to hip
- Wrap arm around thighs/knees and drive forward
- Keep other leg around 45 degrees and use it as a driving anchor

If they don't fall from the initial drive:
1. Stand up and use that leg to drive diagonally a bit, throwing their legs to the other direction, OR
2. Do the weird pigeon/S mount ankle trip

### Single Leg Takedown
