Big on the back.\nSwimming Styles (Freestyle) Total Immersion This form of swimming prioritizes reducing drag, keeping streamlined, and increasing stride length instead of frequency. Seems very chill and a good form for comfort (will probably do this when I\u0026rsquo;m 50), but not the method for high speeds.\nSwim Smooth This form of swimming prioritizes speed by propulsion, and is used by elite swimmers and triathletes. This method focuses on increasing stroke frequency and probably consumes more oxygen and energy.
