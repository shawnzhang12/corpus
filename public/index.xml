      <description>Massively Scalable Key-Value Stores What are key-value stores? Container for key-value pairs (databases) Distributed, multi-component Non-relational Simpler query semantics for increased scalability, speed, availability, and flexibility Why needed?
Big data. Huge amount of internet users, stored data, frequent updates, fast retrievals. Good for failure detection, failure recovery, replication, memory store, versioning.
Horizontal scalability: user growth, more nodes Performance: single-record read and write operations Flexibility: adapt to changing data definitions Reliability: provides failure recovery (failure is the norm), thousands of components at play Availability and geo-distribution: Users are worldwide, data can be accessed worldwide Main operations: PUT, GET, and DELETE.</description>

      <description>Maximum Likelihood Estimate eueu
Perplexity Equation here.
Minimizing perplexity \(\equiv\) maximizing probability of corpus
Uniform corpus distribution = max perplexity
Lower perplexity \(\rightarrow\) Better Model
trigram has lowest perplexity compared to bigram
Zipf and the Natural Distributions in Language Sparseness Longer n-grams will result in more sparsity. Will result in probabilities of 0 when you do multiplications.
Patterns of Unigrams A few words occur very frequently.
Frequency of frequencies:</description>

      <description>General Optimization \(\underset{x}{\text{minimize}}\: f(x)\) \(\text{subject to} \quad c_i(x) = 0, i \in \mathcal{E}\) ‚Äã \(c_i(x) \geq 0, i \in \mathcal{J}\)
for Variables \(x\), Objective Function \(f(x)\) that satisfies \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), Constraints \(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{J}\) Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example.
Notice we don&amp;rsquo;t use strictly greater than. Why? In a continuous domain it is not well-defined. There is no solution to the following optimization as you can get infinitely close to 1, but there is always some \(\delta\) that can be subtracted to get you even closer.</description>
