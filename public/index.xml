      <description>What are we counting? Tokens and types. Instances of words and kinds of words.
Corpora: A body of language data. Most useful when occurring naturally. Be aware of bias.
Vocabulary: Set of unique Words
Size of corpus: Total number of words
Word Order Matters! Should consider past words, but not ALL past words. \(P(car|the\:old) = 0\) may never appear in the corpus, but \(P(old|the) &amp;gt; 0\) and \(P(car|old) &amp;gt; 0\) could be true, \(\therefore P(the\:old\:car) &amp;gt; 0\).</description>

      <description>Massively Scalable Key-Value Stores What are key-value stores? Container for key-value pairs (databases) Distributed, multi-component Non-relational Simpler query semantics for increased scalability, speed, availability, and flexibility Why needed?
Big data. Huge amount of internet users, stored data, frequent updates, fast retrievals. Good for failure detection, failure recovery, replication, memory store, versioning.
Horizontal scalability: user growth, more nodes Performance: single-record read and write operations Flexibility: adapt to changing data definitions Reliability: provides failure recovery (failure is the norm), thousands of components at play Availability and geo-distribution: Users are worldwide, data can be accessed worldwide Main operations: PUT, GET, and DELETE.</description>

      <description>General Optimization \(\underset{x}{\text{minimize}}\: f(x)\) \(\text{subject to} \quad c_i(x) = 0, i \in \mathcal{E}\) ‚Äã \(c_i(x) \geq 0, i \in \mathcal{J}\)
for Variables \(x\), Objective Function \(f(x)\) that satisfies \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), Constraints \(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{J}\) Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example.
Notice we don&amp;rsquo;t use strictly greater than. Why? In a continuous domain it is not well-defined. There is no solution to the following optimization as you can get infinitely close to 1, but there is always some \(\delta\) that can be subtracted to get you even closer.</description>

pop arms with C clamp real fast Get knee between their legs stay upright, head close to hip Wrap arm around thighs/knees and drive forward Keep other leg around 45 degrees and use it as a driving anchor If they don&amp;rsquo;t fall from the initial drive:
Stand up and use that leg to drive diagonally a bit, throwing their legs to the other direction, OR Do the weird pigeon/S mount ankle trip </description>
